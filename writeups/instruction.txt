From Bjarne:
documentation: what does the library/facility offer? what are the public interfaces for people to use? what is the precise semantics?

tutorial: how do I start using the library/facility? See the "how to write a tutorial" paper (posted on the course site)

design document: why is the design the way it is? what are the aims and principles? What alternatives and why were they discarded?

Deliverable:
tutorial.txt (I will finish writing this part)

documentation.docx / documentation.pdf / documentation.txt 
Mainly the contents of 8-11 of the libsheet ppt https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eGyCjfjwbjwKfoy64w2vexxbIHrSf9HtsutGQidFFSs/edit#slide=id.g126c09236c_0_9
Explain the function and the structure. If is possible, also add 16-17 (I am not sure if it is necessary)

design.docx / design.pdf / design.txt
Mainly the contents of 12-14 of the libsheet ppt, and the way we choose to design this library.
